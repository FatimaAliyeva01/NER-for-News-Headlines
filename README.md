# NER-for-News-Headlines


### **Project Overview**
In this project, we develop a Named Entity Recognition (NER) system tailored to identify and classify key entities—such as persons, organizations, and locations—from news headlines. Utilizing the CoNLL-2003 dataset, the project explores how NER can extract insights from unstructured text, demonstrating the value of NER in news analytics and information extraction.

### **Objectives**
- **Data Preparation**: Load and preprocess the CoNLL-2003 dataset for effective model training.
- **Model Development**: Train an NER model using SpaCy and fine-tune it for news headline applications.
- **Evaluation & Analysis**: Assess model performance using standard NLP metrics.
- **Real-world Implementation**: Apply the trained model to new headlines, illustrating potential business applications.
